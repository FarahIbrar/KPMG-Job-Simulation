# KPMG Job Simulation - Introduction to Technology

Welcome to my repository for the KPMG Job Simulation powered by Forage. This simulation consists of five distinct tasks, each designed to provide hands-on experience in various technology and business disciplines. I completed all five tasks and received a certificate, which you can view on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/farah-ibrar-a013b51a9/).

## Overview

While all tasks were informative, I chose to highlight the two tasks that I found most relevant and enjoyable based on my interests and career focus. These tasks are:

1. **Cloud Engineering Task**
2. **Data Analytics Task**

Below, you'll find detailed information about these tasks and their associated files. This README will help you navigate the repository and understand the work involved in each task.
