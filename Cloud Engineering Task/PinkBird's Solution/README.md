# PinkBird Web Application Architecture

---

## Objective of the Architecture

The goal is to design a responsive web application integrated into PinkBirdâ€™s existing website for automating the lifecycle of R&D grant applications. This application will include features for eligibility checks, necessary preparations, and feedback through text mining and machine learning. The architecture will be modular, secure, and scalable, leveraging AWS services.

### Key AWS Components Used

#### Frontend (React Application)
- **AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service):** Hosts static web content of the React-based application, ensuring high availability and durability. Integrates with CloudFront for enhanced content delivery.
- **AWS CloudFront:** Global Content Delivery Network (CDN) that caches content closer to users, reducing latency and improving performance.

#### Backend APIs
- **AWS API Gateway:** Entry point for API requests, offering managed API services for RESTful APIs with caching, logging, and monitoring capabilities.
- **AWS Lambda:** Serverless compute service that handles backend logic, providing scalability and reducing server management overhead.

#### Authentication and Security
- **AWS Cognito:** Manages user authentication and authorization with support for multi-factor authentication (MFA) and integration with third-party identity providers.
- **AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall):** Protects the application against common web threats like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

#### Data Storage
- **Amazon DynamoDB:** NoSQL database providing a fast and flexible document store for user data and session states, with support for auto-scaling and multi-region replication.

#### Machine Learning and NLP
- **Amazon SageMaker:** Used for building, training, and deploying machine learning models for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, providing feedback on R&D grant eligibility and preparation.

#### Monitoring and Logging
- **AWS CloudWatch:** Provides monitoring and logging capabilities to track API requests, application performance, and other key metrics, enabling proactive management and troubleshooting.

### How the Proposed Architecture Meets PinkBird's Requirements

- **Scalability and Cost Efficiency:** AWS Lambda and other serverless components ensure automatic scaling based on demand, reducing costs associated with idle compute time.
- **Modularity and Parallel Development:** The architecture's modular design allows independent development of frontend, backend, and machine learning components.
- **Secure and Reliable Data Management:** AWS Cognito and AWS WAF provide robust security, while Amazon DynamoDB ensures reliable and fast data access.
- **Machine Learning and NLP Integration:** Amazon SageMaker integrates with backend APIs to offer real-time analysis and feedback on grant eligibility and preparation.
- **Compliance and High Availability:** AWS services comply with international standards and support multi-region deployment for high availability and disaster recovery.
